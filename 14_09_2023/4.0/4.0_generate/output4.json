This more elaborate information is contained within the privacy policy, so the Data Safety section is considered incomplete.\n\n2) Incorrect: 1 - Data Safety only mentions \"approximate location\" and \"device or other IDs\" while the Privacy Policy seems to have an extensive list of data categories involved in sharing, including personal data usage. If the Privacy Policy's shared information extends beyond the two categories mentioned in the Data Safety section, we can interpret this as incorrect in terms of not fully mirroring all aspects of data sharing.\n\n3) Inconsistency: 1 - The nature of data being shared according to the Data Safety section (\"approximate location\", \"Device or other IDs\") does not correspond with the Privacy Policy's explanation of the intended use of personal data, user's options, and how the information is used.
