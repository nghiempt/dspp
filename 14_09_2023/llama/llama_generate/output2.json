    "completion": " Based on the information you provided, here's my analysis:\n\nIncomplete: 1 (Yes)\n\nThe Data Safety section only mentions \"Device or other IDs\" as shared data, while the Privacy Policy section on sharing states that the company may share personal information with third-party partners, service providers, and affiliates. This indicates that the Data Safety section needs to provide more comprehensive information about the types of data shared.\n\nIncorrect: 0 (No)\n\nThe Privacy Policy section mentions sharing personal information, including device identifiers, while the Data Safety section only references \"Device or other IDs.\" Even though they are not identical, these two pieces of information aren't necessarily contradictory. Therefore, I won't mark this as incorrect.\n\nInconsistency: 1 (Yes)\n\nAlthough both sources discuss sharing data with third parties, the language used in the Privacy Policy section is more detailed and specific than the Data Safety section. The inconsistency lies in how each section describes the nature of the shared data; the Privacy Policy provides a broader description of personal information, including device identifiers, while the Data Safety section only refers to \"Device or other IDs.\" Therefore, there is a discrepancy in the descriptions provided.",

This inconsistency means that the Privacy Policy provides more detailed information about the use of non-personal information than the Data Safety section.
