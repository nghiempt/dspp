Typically, we will rely on the following legal bases for processing your personal information: (i) your consent; (ii) where our processing is in our legitimate interest or in the legitimate interest of our Ad Partners or Service Providers; or (iii) where our processing is necessary to perform a contract with you (e.g. to make the Games or Websites accessible to you). If we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.\nWe may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal processes, and to establish/exercise our legal rights. We may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. We may share your information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.\nb) Advertising network companies in order to serve contextual advertisements.\nLike most companies, we use tools from service providers to help us with various parts of our business ( \"Service Providers\" ), and depending on the service we need, these Service Providers may have access to your personal information. For example, we use Unity Ads SDK to manage our advertising service, and this Service Provider uses your Advertising ID.
