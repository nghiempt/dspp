        "completion": "Based on the provided information:\n\nIncomplete: 0 - Both the Data Safety and Privacy Policy mention about the sharing of information, but the Privacy Policy provides more details about the purpose of data collection.\n\nIncorrect: 0 - The data safety does not negate or misrepresent any information presented in the privacy policy. However, it's generally noted in the Privacy Policy that only non-personal information is not sold or shared, while it's unclear in the Data Safety's \"No data shared with third parties\" statement whether it pertains to all types of data, or only non-personal data.\n\nInconsistency: 1 - There is inconsistency between the Data Safety and the Privacy Policy. The Data Safety mentions \"No data shared with third parties\" whereas the Privacy Policy specifies \"Non-personal information will not be sold, traded, or rented to any third party but used only for the purpose it was collected\", there's a missing distinction between personal and non-personal data in the Data Safety section.",
