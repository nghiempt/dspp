Disclosure to Your Matches: As an integral part of providing the Gapper service, we will disclose your profile information to your matches. Photos and other profile information posted by you will be available to subscribers that are matched with you. We may also make features available enabling your matches to share your profile information, including photos, with members of their social network(s). We never share your contact information with your matches.\n2. Disclosure By Law: You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law); protect or defend Gapper's, or a third party's, rights or property; or protect someone's health or safety, such as when harm or violence against any person (including you) is threatened.\n3. Disclosure to Protect Abuse Victims: Notwithstanding any other provision of this privacy statement or our Terms of Service, we reserve the right, but have no obligation, to disclose any information that you submit to the Services, if in our sole opinion, we suspect or have reason to suspect, that the information involves a party who may be the victim of abuse in any form. Abuse may include, without limitation, elder abuse, child abuse, spousal abuse, neglect, or domestic violence. Information may be disclosed to authorities that we, in our sole discretion, deem appropriate to handle such disclosure. Appropriate authorities may include, without limitation, law enforcement agencies, child protection agencies, or court officials. You hereby acknowledge and agree that we are permitted to make such disclosure.\n4. Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties by Us: We may share your non-PII with third parties, but not in a manner that would reveal your identity. We may share your PII, sometimes in conjunction with your non-PII, with service providers that may be associated with us to perform functions on our behalf. For example, outsourced customer care agents or technology assistants may need access to your information to perform services for you. Your information will be treated as private and confidential by such service providers and not used for any other purpose than we authorize. In addition, from time to time, we may share PII (such as e-mail or mailing address) about our user base with carefully selected third parties, so they can offer goods and services that we believe may be of interest to our users. If you do not wish to receive offers from our trusted partners, you can change your e-mail preferences at any time.\n5. Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties at Your Request: When purchasing an Gapper subscription or while visiting our Services, we may provide you with advertisements, promotions and offers from third party providers. If you choose to accept any such offers, you may either (depending on the situation) directly provide your information in connection with the offer to such third party provider, or we will provide your information, including billing information, to the third party provider by pre-populating the offer registration forms. Your information will not be transferred until you actually accept the offer. You may opt-out of the offer at any time up until this point. Please refer to the third party provider's own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any questions regarding how your information is used by such providers. Please be aware that these offers may be presented on pages framed by a Gapper Service. We do this to provide a seamless experience. Although these offer pages have the look and feel of our websites, you will be submitting your information directly to the third-party advertiser. You agree that we will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings, including the sharing of the information you supply to us with third party providers described here, or as the result of the presence of such providers on a Gapper Service.\""

The Google Advertising ID is an anonymous identifier, provided by Google Play services. If your device has an Advertising ID, we may collect and use it for advertising and user analytics purposes. Please see below how you can reset you mobile Advertising ID or opt-out of receiving targeted ads through your mobile Advertising IDs.\n- The purpose of using firebase analytics: Enable us to improve the performance and quality of our app.\n- Mobile Device Opt-Out - you may opt out of receiving targeted ads on mobile devices using the Android operating system, by using platform level controls enabled through your device settings. You should consult your device settings and instructions provided by your device manufacturer. However, we provide the following information solely for informational purposes.\n- If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of targeted advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher, and setting \"Limit Ad Tracking\" to \"ON\". You can do this by clicking on Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising, and toggling \"Limit Ad Tracking\" to \"ON\". This prevents apps that you use from using your Apple device\u2019s Advertising Identifier to serve you targeted ads. In addition, or as an alternative, you may reset your device\u2019s Advertising Identifier, which will result in your device being disassociated from ad targeting profiles based on the Advertising Identifier in effect prior to reset. You can do this by clicking on Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising -> Reset Advertising Identifier. Again, you should consult Apple\u2019s support web pages and instructions for the most current applicable settings.\n- If you have an Android device, you can opt out of targeted advertising on your device. You can do this by clicking the menu icon to display the apps list, then find and select the Google Settings icon, then find and select \"Ads\" and check the box \"Opt out of interest-based ads\". In addition, or as an alternative, you may reset your device\u2019s Android advertising ID, which will result in your device being disassociated from ad targeting profiles based on the Android advertising ID in effect prior to reset. You can do this by clicking the menu icon to display the apps list, then find and select the Google Settings icon, then find and select \"Ads\" and selecting \"Reset advertising ID\". Note that Android settings menus may vary among device manufacturers and these instructions may not be accurate for your device. You should consult Google\u2019s settings and instructions for the most current settings information."

We may disclose your information without giving you prior notice if we believe it is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you might have to efforts by third parties to compel disclosure of your information, including legal orders from the government. Your personal information and other data collected by us may be transferred to another company that has acquired our stock or assets, for example, as a result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company's use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy.\"\nNote: Other sections of the content also mention data collection and usage, but they are not specifically focused on sharing information."

Thus, the information in the Data Safety description is incomplete compared to the Privacy Policy. So, yes there is an issue. (Incomplete: 1)\n\n- Incorrect: The Data Safety statement outright claims there is no sharing with third parties, which directly contradicts the Privacy Policy, which specifies conditions under which data may be shared with third parties. This implies that the Data Safety information is incorrect. (Incorrect: 1)\n\n- Inconsistency: As identified above, there is a clear inconsistency between the two statements.

Typically, we will rely on the following legal bases for processing your personal information: (i) your consent; (ii) where our processing is in our legitimate interest or in the legitimate interest of our Ad Partners or Service Providers; or (iii) where our processing is necessary to perform a contract with you (e.g. to make the Games or Websites accessible to you). If we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.\nWe may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal processes, and to establish/exercise our legal rights. We may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. We may share your information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.\nb) Advertising network companies in order to serve contextual advertisements.\nLike most companies, we use tools from service providers to help us with various parts of our business ( \"Service Providers\" ), and depending on the service we need, these Service Providers may have access to your personal information. For example, we use Unity Ads SDK to manage our advertising service, and this Service Provider uses your Advertising ID. We use or may use the following advertising network companies:\n- UnityAds https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy\n- Google AdMob https://policies.google.com/privacy\nWe contractually require all Service Providers to treat your personal information as confidential information and to only use it for the services we need. However, we do not have direct control over how Service Providers use your personal information and we cannot guarantee that our Service Providers will use your personal information as required in our contract with them. For this reason, we are not responsible for our Service Providers' misuse of your personal information."

It is consistent with the Data Safety policy.\n\n2. Incorrect: 1 - The Data Safety statement states that \"No data is shared with third parties\" which is incorrect as per the Privacy Policy. The app apparently uses Admob for ads and Firebase for analytics, both of which could require data sharing - even if it does not personally identify the user.\n\n3. Inconsistency: 1 - There is an inconsistency between the Data Safety statement and the Privacy Policy. While the Data Safety section claims no data is shared with third parties, the Privacy Policy mentions circumstances where data could be shared, such as for ads, analytics, and location-based services.\n\nThus, there are issues with incorrectness and inconsistency between Data Safety and Privacy Policy in this case."
