Disclosure to Your Matches: As an integral part of providing the Gapper service, we will disclose your profile information to your matches. Photos and other profile information posted by you will be available to subscribers that are matched with you. We may also make features available enabling your matches to share your profile information, including photos, with members of their social network(s). We never share your contact information with your matches.\n2. Disclosure By Law: You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law); protect or defend Gapper's, or a third party's, rights or property; or protect someone's health or safety, such as when harm or violence against any person (including you) is threatened.\n3. Disclosure to Protect Abuse Victims: Notwithstanding any other provision of this privacy statement or our Terms of Service, we reserve the right, but have no obligation, to disclose any information that you submit to the Services, if in our sole opinion, we suspect or have reason to suspect, that the information involves a party who may be the victim of abuse in any form. Abuse may include, without limitation, elder abuse, child abuse, spousal abuse, neglect, or domestic violence. Information may be disclosed to authorities that we, in our sole discretion, deem appropriate to handle such disclosure. Appropriate authorities may include, without limitation, law enforcement agencies, child protection agencies, or court officials. You hereby acknowledge and agree that we are permitted to make such disclosure.\n4. Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties by Us: We may share your non-PII with third parties, but not in a manner that would reveal your identity. We may share your PII, sometimes in conjunction with your non-PII, with service providers that may be associated with us to perform functions on our behalf. For example, outsourced customer care agents or technology assistants may need access to your information to perform services for you. Your information will be treated as private and confidential by such service providers and not used for any other purpose than we authorize. In addition, from time to time, we may share PII (such as e-mail or mailing address) about our user base with carefully selected third parties, so they can offer goods and services that we believe may be of interest to our users. If you do not wish to receive offers from our trusted partners, you can change your e-mail preferences at any time.\n5. Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties at Your Request: When purchasing an Gapper subscription or while visiting our Services, we may provide you with advertisements, promotions and offers from third party providers. If you choose to accept any such offers, you may either (depending on the situation) directly provide your information in connection with the offer to such third party provider, or we will provide your information, including billing information, to the third party provider by pre-populating the offer registration forms. Your information will not be transferred until you actually accept the offer. You may opt-out of the offer at any time up until this point. Please refer to the third party provider's own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any questions regarding how your information is used by such providers. Please be aware that these offers may be presented on pages framed by a Gapper Service. We do this to provide a seamless experience. Although these offer pages have the look and feel of our websites, you will be submitting your information directly to the third-party advertiser. You agree that we will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings, including the sharing of the information you supply to us with third party providers described here, or as the result of the presence of such providers on a Gapper Service.\""

The Google Advertising ID is an anonymous identifier, provided by Google Play services. If your device has an Advertising ID, we may collect and use it for advertising and user analytics purposes. Please see below how you can reset you mobile Advertising ID or opt-out of receiving targeted ads through your mobile Advertising IDs.\n- The purpose of using firebase analytics: Enable us to improve the performance and quality of our app.\n- Mobile Device Opt-Out - you may opt out of receiving targeted ads on mobile devices using the Android operating system, by using platform level controls enabled through your device settings. You should consult your device settings and instructions provided by your device manufacturer. However, we provide the following information solely for informational purposes.\n- If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of targeted advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher, and setting \"Limit Ad Tracking\" to \"ON\". You can do this by clicking on Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising, and toggling \"Limit Ad Tracking\" to \"ON\". This prevents apps that you use from using your Apple device\u2019s Advertising Identifier to serve you targeted ads. In addition, or as an alternative, you may reset your device\u2019s Advertising Identifier, which will result in your device being disassociated from ad targeting profiles based on the Advertising Identifier in effect prior to reset. You can do this by clicking on Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising -> Reset Advertising Identifier. Again, you should consult Apple\u2019s support web pages and instructions for the most current applicable settings.\n- If you have an Android device, you can opt out of targeted advertising on your device. You can do this by clicking the menu icon to display the apps list, then find and select the Google Settings icon, then find and select \"Ads\" and check the box \"Opt out of interest-based ads\". In addition, or as an alternative, you may reset your device\u2019s Android advertising ID, which will result in your device being disassociated from ad targeting profiles based on the Android advertising ID in effect prior to reset. You can do this by clicking the menu icon to display the apps list, then find and select the Google Settings icon, then find and select \"Ads\" and selecting \"Reset advertising ID\". Note that Android settings menus may vary among device manufacturers and these instructions may not be accurate for your device.

The Data Safety section mentions \"App activity\" and \"Device or other IDs,\" while the Privacy Policy mentions \"Content of the user\" and \"Identifiers\" separately. Additionally, the Privacy Policy mentions \"Technical information of the device\" under the \"Other information\" category, which is not mentioned in the Data Safety section. Therefore, I score this as 1 (yes) for inconsistency."

Typically, we will rely on the following legal bases for processing your personal information: (i) your consent; (ii) where our processing is in our legitimate interest or in the legitimate interest of our Ad Partners or Service Providers; or (iii) where our processing is necessary to perform a contract with you (e.g. to make the Games or Websites accessible to you). If we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.\nWe may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal processes, and to establish/exercise our legal rights. We may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. We may share your information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.\nb) Advertising network companies in order to serve contextual advertisements.\nLike most companies, we use tools from service providers to help us with various parts of our business ( \"Service Providers\" ), and depending on the service we need, these Service Providers may have access to your personal information. For example, we use Unity Ads SDK to manage our advertising service, and this Service Provider uses your Advertising ID. We use or may use the following advertising network companies:\n- UnityAds https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy\n- Google AdMob https://policies.google.com/privacy\nWe contractually require all Service Providers to treat your personal information as confidential information and to only use it for the services we need. However, we do not have direct control over how Service Providers use your personal information and we cannot guarantee that our Service Providers will use your personal information as required in our contract with them. For this reason, we are not responsible for our Service Providers' misuse of your personal information."

See Section 6 \u201cYour Choices About Your Information\u201d of this Privacy Policy for further instructions.\nProfessionals and Other Users\nBusiness Transfers and Affiliates\nWe may share your information with companies or organizations connected or affiliated with SNOW.

However, the Privacy Policy mentions additional types of information that may be shared, such as usage data and personal information. Therefore, the Data Safety section is incomplete compared to the Privacy Policy.\n\nIncorrect: 0 (No)\n\nThe Data Safety section does not mention any incorrect information. It only provides a limited list of information that may be shared, which is not necessarily incorrect.\n\nInconsistency: 1 (Yes)\n\nThe description of the sharing information in the Data Safety section is inconsistent with the Privacy Policy. The Data Safety section states that the app may share location and device IDs, while the Privacy Policy mentions that the app may share usage data and personal information with third-party service providers. This inconsistency suggests that the app may collect and share more information than what is mentioned in the Data Safety section."
