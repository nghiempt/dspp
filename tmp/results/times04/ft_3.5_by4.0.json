We may also make features available enabling your matches to share your profile information, including photos, with members of their social network(s). We never share your contact information with your matches.\n2. Disclosure By Law: You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law); protect or defend Gapper's, or a third party's, rights or property; or protect someone's health or safety, such as when harm or violence against any person (including you) is threatened.\n3. Disclosure to Protect Abuse Victims: Notwithstanding any other provision of this privacy statement or our Terms of Service, we reserve the right, but have no obligation, to disclose any information that you submit to the Services, if in our sole opinion, we suspect or have reason to suspect, that the information involves a party who may be the victim of abuse in any form. Abuse may include, without limitation, elder abuse, child abuse, spousal abuse, neglect, or domestic violence. Information may be disclosed to authorities that we, in our sole discretion, deem appropriate to handle such disclosure. Appropriate authorities may include, without limitation, law enforcement agencies, child protection agencies, or court officials. You hereby acknowledge and agree that we are permitted to make such disclosure.\n4. Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties by Us: We may share your non-PII with third parties, but not in a manner that would reveal your identity. We may share your PII, sometimes in conjunction with your non-PII, with service providers that may be associated with us to perform functions on our behalf. For example, outsourced customer care agents or technology assistants may need access to your information to perform services for you. Your information will be treated as private and confidential by such service providers and not used for any other purpose than we authorize. In addition, from time to time, we may share PII (such as e-mail or mailing address) about our user base with carefully selected third parties, so they can offer goods and services that we believe may be of interest to our users. If you do not wish to receive offers from our trusted partners, you can change your e-mail preferences at any time.\n5. Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties at Your Request: When purchasing an Gapper subscription or while visiting our Services, we may provide you with advertisements, promotions and offers from third party providers. If you choose to accept any such offers, you may either (depending on the situation) directly provide your information in connection with the offer to such third party provider, or we will provide your information, including billing information, to the third party provider by pre-populating the offer registration forms. Your information will not be transferred until you actually accept the offer. You may opt-out of the offer at any time up until this point. Please refer to the third party provider's own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any questions regarding how your information is used by such providers. Please be aware that these offers may be presented on pages framed by a Gapper Service. We do this to provide a seamless experience. Although these offer pages have the look and feel of our websites, you will be submitting your information directly to the third-party advertiser. You agree that we will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings, including the sharing of the information you supply to us with third party providers described here, or as the result of the presence of such providers on a Gapper Service.\"",

You can do this by clicking on Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising, and toggling \"Limit Ad Tracking\" to \"ON\". This prevents apps that you use from using your Apple device\u2019s Advertising Identifier to serve you targeted ads. In addition, or as an alternative, you may reset your device\u2019s Advertising Identifier, which will result in your device being disassociated from ad targeting profiles based on the Advertising Identifier in effect prior to reset.

        "completion": "The analysis between the Data Safety and Privacy Policy information for the 'Share' section indicates:\n\nIncomplete: 1\nThe Data Safety section does mention no third parties are shared with, however, it does not provide complete details on the exact type or extent of data shared with third party services like Advertisements and Analytics, as mentioned in the Privacy Policy.\n\nIncorrect: 0\nThe Data Safety section does not give any information that is contrary to the Privacy Policy. It does not make any effort to mention something the Privacy Policy doesn't already, it's simply not as detailed as the latter.\n\nInconsistency: 1\nThere is an inconsistency between the two sections. While the Data Safety section declares no data is shared with third parties, the Privacy Policy states that anonymous data including your interests and location might be collected and used by third-party companies for advertising and analytics purposes, although this data would not be used to personally identify you. This indicates a sharing of data, which is inconsistent with the statement of no data being shared in the Data Safety section.",
